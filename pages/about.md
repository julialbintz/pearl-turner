## About the Pearl V. Turner Collection

 Pearl Turner, an alumna from the University of Colorado Boulder Class of 1904, lived and climbed in Colorado, as well as across the United States, in the early 20th century. According to historical documents, she spent many years as a teacher and lived for a period of time in Colorado Springs, Colorado on Weber street. She was an early member of the Colorado Mountain Club and was an active member until at least 1959. The Pearl V. Turner Collection at the University of Colorado Boulder houses original items from Pearl Turner, including two photo albums about her mountaineering trips and her collection of mountaineering literature, including magazines, Colorado Mountain Club newsletters, and plant-identifying books, among other print materials. This digital exhibit explores and highlights her personal photo album from a 1914 mountaineering trip with the Colorado Mountain Club in what would become Rocky Mountain National Park the following year. The album documents the trip with film photographs and typewritten journal pages describing Pearl's persepctive, experiences, and life in Rocky Mountain months before it was recognized as a national site.

## Research
For this research project, we viewed the collection with ample assistance from RaD, both in and outside the reading room. While our digital exhibit project focuses on the album in box 1 about a trip to what was not yet Rocky Mountain National Park in 1914, we looked at every item in the box to build a contextual understanding of Pearl V. Turner and her involvement in mountaineering in the 20th century. For making the digital exhibit, we worked with RaD to scan the two photo albums, including the printed materials within the photo albums, created metadata about the first photo album, and built the website using CollectionBuilder and StoryMaps. Julia Bintz and Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara primary built the github repository and corresponding website. More information about the research process is on the github wiki.
